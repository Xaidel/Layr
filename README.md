# No-Code Platform (Proof of Concept)

This is a **proof-of-concept no-code platform** built with [React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/).  

The goal is to explore how **composable UI primitives** can serve as the foundation for a drag-and-drop / no-code builder experience.

⚠️ **Note:** This is an **experimental prototype**. It’s not production-ready.

## Features (so far)

- ⚡ Built with **React + Vite**
- 🎨 Styling with **Tailwind CSS**
- 🧩 UI powered by **shadcn/ui** components (Button, Card, Dialog, etc.)
- 🏗️ Early **drag-and-drop proof-of-concept**
- 🔧 Planned: **JSON → UI rendering** for dynamic layouts
